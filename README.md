# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am Tony Xiang

I am a distribution power system expert with a passion for open-source and scientific software engineering. I am active in open-source projects for power system modeling, simulation, and optimization, as well as in generic projects for data science and numerical computing. I love to program in C++ for high-performance implementation of core algorithms and in Python for data analysis and visualization.

Currently, I am working as Principal Scientist at [Alliander N.V.](https://github.com/alliander-opensource), a Dutch distribution system operator (DSO). I am the founder and an active maintainer of the open-source project [Power Grid Model (PGM)](https://github.com/PowerGridModel), which aims for high-performance calculation of steady-state distribution power system. The library is beding widely used in academia and industry.

I have a PhD in electrical power engineering from [Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)](https://github.com/EES-TUe) and I am currently appointed as part-time Assitant Proefessor at TU/e. I am responsible for the lecture Power System Computation and Simulation. The lecture ultizes the [GitHub environment](https://github.com/tue-ees-5xwg0) for students to learn professional software engineering in the context of power system modelling.
