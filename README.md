# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am Tony Xiang

I am a distribution power system expert with a passion for open-source and scientific software engineering. I am active in open-source projects for power system modeling, simulation, and optimization, as well as in generic projects for data science and numerical computing. I love program in C++ for high-performance implementation of core algorithms and in Python for data analysis and visualization.

Currently, I am working as Principal Scientist at Alliander N.V., a Dutch distribution system operator (DSO). My main responsibilities include grid modeling, simulation, and optimization.

I am the founder and an active maintainer of the open-source project [Power Grid Model (PGM)](https://github.com/PowerGridModel), which aims for high-performance calculation of steady-state distribution power system. The library is beding widely used in academia and industry.
